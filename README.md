# Emotions-Hugging-Face

Here I used the Hugging Face classification model - Bert and Roberta base to determine whether the SMS is spam or ham.

The source of the dataset is https://www.kaggle.com/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp

The performance of both the models is as follow:

BERT MODEL
The accuracy, f1 score , recall, and precision on the test dataset is 92.8% ,92.7%, 92.8% and 92.8% respectively. 

ROBERTA BASE MODEL
The accuracy, f1 score , recall, and precision on the test dataset is 92.2% ,92.1%, 92.2% and 92.2% respectively. 

Overall, the performance of the Bert model is slighly better than Roberta Base model on this dataset.
